## **This is a RMarkdown file**

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. The current format is MS Word. Below enclosed is a descriptive analysis of an existing data of trees.

```{r}
summary(trees)
```


## **Statistical Analysis**

A linear regression model is generated with girth and height as predictors, while volume being the dependent variable. From the model, it is inferred that both the predictors are significant at 95% confidence interval. Moreover, the model itself being significant (p-value less that 5&) would generate near to accurate results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(lm(trees$Volume~trees$Height+trees$Girth))
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
